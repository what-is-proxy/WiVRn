# Configurable items:
## `scale`
Default value: `0.8`

Controls the size of the video stream, either a number between 0 and 1 or a pair of numbers between 0 and 1. If two numbers are provided the first one is horizontal scale and the second vertical.
Scaling is applied in a foveated fashion: the center has a 1:1 ratio and the rest is scaled so that the total number of pixels matches the desired scale.

### Examples:
```json
{
	"scale": 0.5
}
```
The x and y resolution of the streamed video are half the size on the headsed, reduces the required bandwidth and encoding/decoding time by about 4.

```json
{
	"scale": [0.75, 0.5]
}
```
Scales x by a 0.75 factor, and y by a 0.5 factor.

## `bitrate`
Default value: `50000000` (50Mb/s)

Bitrate of the video, in bit/s. Split among decoders based on size and codecs.

## `encoders`
A list of encoders to use.

Default value: single encoder if using Nvidia or software encoding. Split into 3 sequential parts (1/8th, 3/8th, 4/8th) if using vaapi.

WiVRn has the ability to split the video in blocks that are processed independently, this may use resources more effectively and reduce latency.
All the provided encoders are put into groups, groups are executed concurrently and items within a group are processed sequentially.

### `encoder`
Default value: `nvenc` if Nvidia GPU and compiled with cuda, `vaapi` for all other GPU when compiled with ffmpeg, else `x265`.

Identifier of the encoder, one of `x265` (software encoding), `nvenc` (Nvidia hardware encoding), `vaapi` (AMD/Intel hardware encoding)

### `codec`
Default value: `h265`

If using `x265` encoder, `h265` is used.

### `width`, `height`, `offset_x`, `offset_y` (advanced)
Default values: full image (`width` = 1, `height` = 1, `offset_x` = 0, `offset_y` = 0)

Specifies the portion of the video to encode: all values are in 0, 1 range. Left eye image ranges from x 0 to x 0.5 and y 0 to 1, Rigth eye is x from 0.5 to 1 and y 0 to 1.

### `group` (very advanced)
Default value: First unused group identifier, if omitted on all encoders, they are executed concurrently.

Identifier (number) of the encoder group. Encoders with the same identifier are executed sequentially, in the order they are defined in the configuration. Encoders with different identifiers are executed concurrently.

### Examples
1. Simple encoder
```json
{
	"bitrate": 50000000,
	"encoders": [
		{
			"encoder": "vaapi",
			"codec": "h265"
		}
	]
}
```
Creates a single encoder, using vaapi hardware encoding, h265 video codec (HEVC) and 50Mb/s bitrate.

2. Hardware + software encoder
```json
{
	"bitrate": 50000000,
	"encoders": [
		{
			"encoder": "vaapi",
			"codec": "h265",
			"width": 0.5,
			"height": 1,
			"offset_x": 0,
			"offset_y": 0
		},
		{
			"encoder": "x265",
			"codec": "h265",
			"width": 0.5,
			"height": 1,
			"offset_x": 0.5,
			"offset_y": 0
		}
	]
}
```
Creates a hardware encoder for left eye, and a software encoder for right eye.

3. 2 Hardware encoders
```json
{
	"bitrate": 50000000,
	"encoders": [
		{
			"encoder": "vaapi",
			"codec": "h265",
			"width": 0.5,
			"height": 1,
			"offset_x": 0,
			"offset_y": 0,
			"group": 0
		},
		{
			"encoder": "vaapi",
			"codec": "h265",
			"width": 0.5,
			"height": 1,
			"offset_x": 0.5,
			"offset_y": 0,
			"group": 0
		}
	]
}
```
Creates two hardware encoders, one for left eye and one for right eye, executed sequentially as they have the same `group`.
This allows the left eye image to be encoded faster than the full image would be, so network transfer starts earlier, and decoding starts earlier. While the total encoding, transfer and decoding time remain the same or are longer, this can reduce the latency.

### `device`, only for vaapi
Default value: unset

Manually specify the device for encoding, can be used to offload encode to an iGPU. Device shall be in the form "/dev/dri/renderD128".


### `options` (very advanced), only for vaapi
Default value: unset

Json object of additional options to pass directly to ffmpeg `avcodec_open2`'s `option` parameter.

## `application`
Default value: unset

An application to start when connection with the headset is established, can be a string or an array of strings if parameters need to be provided.

### Example
```json
{
	"application": ["steam", "steam://launch/275850/VR"]
}
```
Launch No Man's Sky in VR mode on Steam when connection with headset is established.

## `tcp_only`
Default value: `false`

Only use TCP for communications with the client, this may have increased latency.
If `false` or unset, WiVRn will use both TCP and UDP.

### Example
```json
{
	"tcp_only": true
}
```
